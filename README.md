# PortSwigger Web Security Academy – Labs

This repository contains my hands-on work from completing labs on the
PortSwigger Web Security Academy.  
The focus of this repository is **practical exploitation**, not theory.

All work was performed in a legal, controlled lab environment.

## Documentation Approach

Due to the large number of labs:

- Complex or non-trivial labs include **detailed markdown write-ups**
- Repetitive labs are intentionally kept minimal

This reflects a real-world workflow where efficiency matters.
