# Access Control

This folder contains proof-of-work from solving
PortSwigger Web Security Academy labs related to access control vulnerabilities.

The focus is on bypassing authorization checks
by abusing flawed permission enforcement.

---

## Approach

- Identification of protected resources and roles
- Testing for horizontal and vertical privilege escalation
- Manipulation of user identifiers and request parameters
- Direct access to restricted functionality

---

## Tools

- Burp Suite
- Browser
- Manual request manipulation

---

## Notes

Access control vulnerabilities occur when applications
fail to properly enforce authorization rules.
Impact includes unauthorized data access and privilege escalation.
Documentation emphasizes authorization logic, not authentication.
