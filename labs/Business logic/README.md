# Business Logic Testing

This folder contains scripts and proof-of-work from solving
PortSwigger Web Security Academy labs related to business logic flaws.

The focus is on identifying and abusing broken application workflows
rather than exploiting input validation issues.

---

## Approach

- Manual analysis of application workflows
- Identification of trust assumptions and flawed state handling
- Abuse of multi-step processes and missing server-side checks
- Exploitation of edge cases not covered by business rules

---

## Tools

- Burp Suite
- Python

---

## Notes

Business logic vulnerabilities often require understanding how the
application is intended to work.
Documentation is kept minimal and focuses on execution and results.
