# SQL Injection

This folder contains proof-of-work from solving
PortSwigger Web Security Academy labs related to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

The focus is on understanding how user input is incorporated
into SQL queries and exploiting flawed query construction.

---

## Approach

- Identification of injectable parameters
- Analysis of query behavior through error-based and blind techniques
- Data extraction using boolean and time-based logic
- Authentication and authorization bypass where applicable

---

## Tools

- Burp Suite
- Browser
- Manual payload crafting
- Custom scripts (Python)

---

## Notes

SQL injection vulnerabilities arise from improper query construction
and lack of parameterized statements.
Documentation emphasizes query logic and data extraction strategies
rather than payload memorization.
